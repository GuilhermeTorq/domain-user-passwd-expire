# domain-user-passwd-expire
This script send a notification via email to each user that has its domain user password almost expiring, the default days left are in 0, 1, 5, 10 days but you can set to however day you want, it can be anywhere between 0 and 999+ days remaining.

The script right off the bat will work with a file I named and made available "userdata.txt" so that you can test with it. But to use the information of the actual server you will have to delete or comment the line 34 & 35 and UNCOMMENT the line 28 and 31  
!! Check line 33

The script will run the command:
```
$userInfo = Get-ADUser -filter {Enabled -eq $True -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $False} â€“Properties "DisplayName", "mail", "msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed" |
Select-Object -Property "DisplayName","Mail",@{Name="ExpiryDate";Expression={[datetime]::FromFileTime($_."msDS-UserPasswordExpiryTimeComputed")}}, mail
```
Which will get the name, email and password expire date of the domain users, the file "userdata.txt" that I made available is an example of the output this command gets and works with.  

Before working with that information, it will be cleaned first as to remove unnecessary spaces to dodge errors, so you can edit the expire dates for testing without worring about the format.
The script always checks for the time on the computer/domain it is being run on.

With the informationg grabbed, it will then filter out only the informationg with dates and check how manys days from now to the expire date, if the number is equal to any of the ones in the switch code, it will grab that user information and send an email to him.

### How to add different trigger dates
The following command is what decides the dates
```
switch ($duration.Days)
        {
            0 { $userName = $line.split(" ")[0]; $mail = $line.split(" ")[1]; $date = $extractedDate; $days = "0" }
            1 { $userName = $line.split(" ")[0]; $mail = $line.split(" ")[1]; $date = $extractedDate; $days = "1" }
            5 { $userName = $line.split(" ")[0]; $mail = $line.split(" ")[1]; $date = $extractedDate; $days = "5"  }
            10 { $userName = $line.split(" ")[0]; $mail = $line.split(" ")[1]; $date = $extractedDate; $days = "10"  }
            Default { $null; break }
        }
```
> What you only need to change are the first numbers (0, 1, 5, 10) and the last numbers on each line (0, 1, 5, 10), so if you change any of them, you have to change both.

> Now, if you want to add or remove days, you just have to delete that line OR add another and you only need to change the first and last number

### How to change language on email body and smtp
Do NOT change anything that follows the symbol $  

You have to change the "from" email address on line 10  

SMTP:  
On lines 13 and 14 change the smtpport and the smtpserver to the one your network administrator gave you. Also check the documentation - [Smartbear config/smtp](https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/docs/enterprise/v1/config/smtp.html)  

Email body:  
On line 8, you can change the body to any format you want, just remember that to add a newline, you have to add in between: \`n  
If you want a direct translation from what is there by default, just replace the whole line with:  
```
line 8: $emailBody = "\`n\`n!Warning Alert!\`n\`nUser password will expire on $date ($days days)\`n\`nUser: $username\`nEmail: $mail\`n\`nYours sincerely,\`nServer\`n\`n"  
line 12: $subject = "Your user password will expire in $days days!"
```
